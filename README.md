# Hack Match

## What is it? 

Hack Matchs' mission is to help connect programmers, developers, and engineers who can _help each other_ become better at whatever they're both intested in. Matches made on the platform allows people to reach out to each other and use platforms like `codebuddies`, `slack`, `devcord`, `glitch`, `codepen`, `stackblitz`, `google hangouts`, `email` or other communication and collaboration platform to schedule remote code pairing sessions, talk, or feel less alone/be productive while working on something together. 

**The problem:**

1. Many people are intimidated by communication and collaboration platforms, are too shy, or don't know how to reach out.
2. When they join a platform, they see that a channel they're interested in looks quiet, feel discouraged, and leave. Or they try to start a project and not many people show interest in helping out, so they get discouraged and give up. 
3. People may miss a post someone else shared a while back, or on a different platform, about a project or common interest that would have been a good match. 
4. A project they're interested in looks too advanced and they don't know how they would even start to help... or even where to get started... or they are unsure and lack the confidence to try.  
5. ***It can be difficult to find other people who have similar interests that would be a good match***
6. It is very easy to slack off, procrastinate, get distracted, and lose interest and motivation. 

**The solution:**

1. By getting a custom match who to reach out to, and how to reach out.
2. By getting matched directly with the person who is looking to help out with a project, or the person looking for help, it is known immediately that there is interest. 
3. Hatch Match becomes the central location to find common interests and projects and results are sorted by match score, not time. 
4. The person will get matched directly with an OS contributor that can give direction and help to get started.
5. The core problem this platform solves. As it grows the matching will get better and better. 
6. Get matched with someone willing to help with motivation.   


## How to contribute

1. Just email phpninja@mail.com, or make a pull request. 

Tips:

- If you need help or would like to pair on an issue, just reach out.

Feel free to file new issues. We're looking for design, UX, and code (any lanugage) help.

If you see an issue under the `help wanted` category that you'd like to tackle, please comment that you're working on it, and create a new branch for the issue.

Once the prototype is complete, we'll also need volunteer moderators/matchers.

Please submit new pull requests against the `staging` branch.
