        Working as an on-premise Data Engineer these past couple of years,
        I had the luxury of working within firewalls upon firewalls right in
        the center of our intrAnet. Our SQL Servers room was locked behind a
        reinforced quadra locked door with 24/7 camera's.

        Thanks to the Corona virus that business had to layoff tons of workers, so
        I'm back in the real world. And PHP is still perceived as a web language
        (even though I was using it for Data Analysis & Data Engineering).
