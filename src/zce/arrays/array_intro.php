    <h3>With a lot of Power, comes a lot of Memory</h3>
    <p>
        PHPs' arrays get used for everything. They're super easy to learn and use <br>
        ... but they can COST Megabytes OR Gigabytes of memory. This is when I pass that data to  <br>
        a db server & invoke a SQL <b>stored procedure</b> to operate in sync w/PHP.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, for us <i>Practical</i> Computer Science type, we can use alternate data structures <br>
        or clever hacks to improve the array. PHP after all, is VERY powerful, I like to think of it <br>
        as the skin over the C source code muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
        To improve the runtime memory efficiency, we can use Streams, SPL Data Structures, <br>
        C extensions, & generators to yield a data table and just use an array per row.
