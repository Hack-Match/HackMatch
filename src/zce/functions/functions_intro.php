    <h3>Why I find functional programming to be useful:</h3>
    <p>
        Although PHP isn't as much of a functional programming language as JavaScript, <br>
        all of the practical features can still be emulated. In PHP we can use the "use" <br>
        keyword to get access to outer scope which is <b>immensely</b> useful.
