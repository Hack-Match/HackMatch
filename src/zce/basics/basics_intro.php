        The basic building blocks.

    <p class="ja-personal-experience">
        I've been programming since I was 18 years old. So I've learned this part over and OVER <br>
        again in the excessive amount of languages there are.<br>
        After 12+ years I'm digging my heals in at PHP, unless I get paid to learn a different language.
    </p>
    
    <p class="ja-personal-experience">
        All the main languages are a descendent of the <b>C programming language</b> <br>
        so they're each pretty similar. <br>
    </p>
    
    <p class="ja-personal-experience">
        The breakdown of my <i>Programming Language</i> experience: <br>
        <ul>
        <li>18-22 years old: Visual Basic, C, Python, C++, & a bit of Java (but I was a C++ Evangelist back then)</li>
        <li>23 years old: Focused more on General Education classes & my "Retail Auditor" job.</li>
        <li>24-25 years old: C# via the Unity Game Engine. <b>Dropped out of College Officially :'(</b></li>
        <li>26-27 years old: AngularJS, JavaScript, Node.js</li>
        <li>28-Present: PHP, SQL, Node.js, JavaScript, AngularJS and a bit of .NET C#</li>
        </ul>
